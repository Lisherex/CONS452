Gustav tracked northwestward across the Gulf toward Louisiana and made landfall as a category 2 hurricane near Cocodrie, Louisiana during the morning of September 1st. Gustav continued to move northwest across south Louisiana and weakened to a Category 1 storm over south central Louisiana later that day. The storm diminished to a tropical depression over northwestern Louisiana on September 2nd. ||The highest wind gust recorded was 102 knots or 117 mph at a USGS site at the Houma Navigational Canal and at the Pilot Station Est C-MAN at near the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River. The highest sustained wind of 91 mph was recorded at the Pilot's Station East C-MAN site. |However, due to the failure of equipment at some observation sites during the storm higher winds may have occurred. The minimum sea level pressure measured was 951.6 millibars at a USGS site at Caillou Lake southwest of Dulac and 954.5 millibars at the LUMCON facility near Dulac. Rainfall varied considerably across southeast Louisiana ranging from around 4 inches to just over 11 inches.||Gustav produced widespread wind damage across southeast Louisiana, especially in the area from Houma and Thibodaux through the greater Baton Rouge area. Hurricane force wind gusts occurred across the inland areas through the Baton Rouge area and surrounding parishes. A peak wind gust of 91 mph was recorded at the Baton Rouge (Ryan Field) Airport at 112 PM CST. This was only one mph less than the highest wind gust recorded during Hurricane Betsy in 1965.

This low developed into a tropical depression on November 4th and then strengthened into a tropical storm a little later that same day. Ida then increased to hurricane strength on November 5th before shortly thereafter making landfall in Nicaragua. After weakening to a tropical depression while over land in Nicaragua and Honduas, Ida emerged back into the western Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane once again late on November 7th as it tracked north toward the southern Gulf of Mexico. Ida continued north into the central Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane before weakening to a tropical storm early November 9th as moved into the northern Gulf. The storm briefly became a hurricane once again later that day south of the Mississippi River and then weakened to a tropical storm late on November 9th as it encountered increasing wind shear and cooler waters. Ida moved across the southeast Louisiana and Mississippi coastal waters as a tropical storm late on the 9th and early on the 10th of November. Ida became extratropical on the morning of November 10th and dissiapated over the Florida panhandle on November 11th. ||Tropical Storm Ida's effects on coastal areas of southeast Louisiana were relatively minor as the storm weakened as it moved across the coastal waters east of the Mississippi River and only brushed the region. Moderate beach erosion did occur in lower Jefferson Parish where storm surge eroded 100 to 200 feet of beach and cut a new pass through Elmer's Island adjacent to Grand Isle. In addition, on Grand Isle in lower Jefferson Parish two or three homes were threatened when a 1000 foot section of a local levee on the western side of the island collapsed as waters from Barataria Bay began to rise. Several roads were closed due to flooding outside the levee protection system in St. Bernard Parish, and minor flooding occurred in low lying areas of St. Tammany Parish around Lacombe, Bayou Liberty and the Rigolets.

The initial two boaters were rescued.","Ida developed from a tropical wave moving over the southwestern Caribbean Sea that spawned an area of low pressure on November 2nd. This low developed into a tropical depression on November 4th and then strengthened into a tropical storm a little later that same day. Ida then increased to hurricane strength on November 5th before shortly thereafter making landfall in Nicaragua. After weakening to a tropical depression while over land in Nicaragua and Honduas, Ida emerged back into the western Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane once again late on November 7th as it tracked north toward the southern Gulf of Mexico. Ida continued north into the central Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane before weakening to a tropical storm early November 9th as moved into the northern Gulf. The storm briefly became a hurricane once again later that day south of the Mississippi River and then weakened to a tropical storm late on November 9th as it encountered increasing wind shear and cooler waters. Ida moved across the southeast Louisiana and Mississippi coastal waters as a tropical storm late on the 9th and early on the 10th of November. Ida became extratropical on the morning of November 10th and dissiapated over the Florida panhandle on November 11th. ||Tropical Storm Ida's effects on coastal areas of southeast Louisiana were relatively minor as the storm weakened as it moved across the coastal waters east of the Mississippi River and only brushed the region. Moderate beach erosion did occur in lower Jefferson Parish where storm surge eroded 100 to 200 feet of beach and cut a new pass through Elmer's Island adjacent to Grand Isle. In addition, on Grand Isle in lower Jefferson Parish two or three homes were threatened when a 1000 foot section of a local levee on the western side of the island collapsed as waters from Barataria Bay began to rise. Several roads were closed due to flooding outside the levee protection system in St. Bernard Parish, and minor flooding occurred in low lying areas of St. Tammany Parish around Lacombe, Bayou Liberty and the Rigolets. One direct fatality occurred in Plaquemines Parish when a man attempting to assist a boat in distress drowned in the Mississippi River near Fort Jackson. The maximum sustained wind recorded in the vicinity of coastal southeast Louisiana was 52 knots at Pilots Station East near the mouth of the Mississippi River. The peak wind gust for the event of 64 knots was recorded at the same location. The storm surge during the event generally ranged from around 2 to 6.5 feet along the southeast Louisiana coast with a maximum of 6.53 feet at Bay Gardene in Plaquemines Parish. Rainfall totals were generally around 1 inch or less. The minimum observed barometric pressure was 1003.9 mb at Pilots Staion East in lower Plaquemines Parish.",88

Isaac strengthened into a hurricane on the morning of the 28th when it was 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac?????  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities.

Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet.

A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish.

A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish. On Sept 3, a 90 year old man died of heat related impacts in his house in Marrero, Jefferson Parish, where power had not been restored.",192

The weak low pressure system continued to move west-southwest and strengthen, and was eventually classified as Tropical Storm Barry on the morning of July 11th, 95 miles south southeast of the Mouth of the Mississippi River.||Barry continued to move slowly west then northwest and briefly reached hurricane strength on the morning of July 13th before landfall in south-central Louisiana near Intracoastal City, LA, in Vermillion Parish. Tropical storm force winds, reached the southeast Louisiana coast by midday on Friday, July 12th and spread slowly northwest reaching the Baton Rouge area during the evening of July 12th. Tropical storm wind impacts had ended across all of southeast Louisiana by midday on July 14th. Tropical storm force winds were primarily measured in gusts across southeast Louisiana. The|exception was in Terrebonne and Assumption Parishes, close to the landfall location, where sustained tropical storm force winds and frequent gusts caused more significant power line and tree damage. A few tropical storm wind gusts were recorded in the metro New Orleans area but were not very impactful. No hurricane force wind gusts were recorded in southeast Louisiana. A WeatherFlow site at Dulac, Terrebonne Parish, recorded both the maximum sustained wind and highest wind gust on 07/13/2019 at 0739CST: 42kt/48 mph and 59kt/ 68 mph, respectively. The lowest minimum pressure measured in southeast Louisiana was at the Bootheville, LA ASOS with a pressure of 999.3mb on July 12th, at 1706CST.||Mostly minor to moderate storm surge flooding occurred across coastal southeast Louisiana, including Lake Pontchartrain, and a small part of the Mississippi Coast. Terrebonne Parish had significant storm surge flooding in the lower portion of the parish with storm tides of 5 to 8 feet, locally up to 9 feet. Several local levees were overtopped on the morning of July 13th, flooding roads and a few houses. The highest storm tide reading was 9.11 feet NAVD88 at a USGS tide gage at Caillou Lake near Dulac, Terrebonne Parish. The remainder of the area had storm tide readings in the 3 to 5 foot range.||Storm total rainfall was generally between 4 and 8 inches with a maximum rainfall of 8.83 inches recorded northeast of Denham Springs, Livingston Parish. Isolated flash flooding of streets and secondary roadways occurred on Sunday, July 13th in the greater Baton Rouge area, but flash flooding was not widespread or significant.||The lower Mississippi River was at unusually high stages from late August with the stage at the New Orleans Carrolton gauge near 16.5 ft. The combination of storm surge  entering the lower Mississippi River with very high river stages prompted concern of potential overtopping of MS River levees in lower Plaquemines Parish, prompting some evacuations in that area.",321
